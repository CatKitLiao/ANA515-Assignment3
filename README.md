In this assignment, I obtained and cleaned the dataset of the year 2000 from NOAAâ€™s Storm Events Database.
There are 10 steps in completing this assignment, which were marked in the code file.
The goal of this assignment is to clean the sort the dataset as the directions said, as well as create a plot in the end.
